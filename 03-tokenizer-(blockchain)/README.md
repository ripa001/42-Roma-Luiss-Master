# 42Skate Token - Skateboarding Trick Validation on BNB Chain 🛹

## Overview

42Skate Token is a BEP-20 compliant token built on BNB Chain that revolutionizes the skateboarding community by creating a decentralized validation and reward system for skateboarding tricks. This token represents reputation, skill, and credibility within the skateboarding ecosystem.

### Project Inspiration

The project bridges the gap between traditional skateboarding culture and blockchain technology. By tokenizing trick validation, we create a permanent, verifiable record of skateboarding achievements while fostering community engagement and peer recognition.

## Why BNB Chain?

We chose BNB Chain for several compelling reasons:

- **Low Transaction Fees**: Essential for frequent trick validations and micro-rewards
- **High Performance**: Fast transaction finality for real-time trick validation
- **EVM Compatibility**: Leverages existing Solidity expertise and tooling
- **Growing Ecosystem**: Strong support for gaming and sports-related dApps
- **Active Community**: Vibrant developer community and extensive documentation

## Technical Stack

- **Smart Contract Language**: Solidity 0.8.19
- **Development Framework**: Hardhat
- **Testing**: Hardhat Test Suite with Ethers.js
- **Deployment**: Hardhat Deploy Scripts
- **Wallet**: MetaMask
- **Network**: BNB Smart Chain Testnet

## Contract Details

- **Token Name**: 42Skate Token
- **Symbol**: 42SK8
- **Decimals**: 18
- **Total Supply**: 42,000,000 42SK8 (minted progressively)
- **Contract Address**: `0x8b0c3e39e1fF40001D94B0f2094b64aDF4406d58`
- **Network**: BNB Smart Chain Testnet
- **Chain ID**: 97
- **BSCScan**: https://testnet.bscscan.com/address/0x8b0c3e39e1fF40001D94B0f2094b64aDF4406d58

## Key Features

1. **Validator Role System**: Only approved validators can mint tokens for verified tricks
2. **Trick Validation Rewards**: Skaters earn 42SK8 tokens for successfully validated tricks
3. **Community Governance**: Token holders can participate in ecosystem decisions
4. **Anti-Spam Mechanisms**: Cooldown periods and validation limits
5. **Transparent Validation**: All validations are recorded on-chain

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. Node.js (v16 or higher)
2. npm or yarn
3. MetaMask wallet
4. Test BNB from [BNB Testnet Faucet](https://testnet.bnbchain.org/faucet-smart)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/trick42-token.git
cd trick42-token

# Install dependencies
cd code
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp deployment/.env.example deployment/.env
# Edit .env with your private key and other configurations
```

### Deployment

```bash
# Compile the contract
npx hardhat compile

# Run tests
npx hardhat test

# Deploy to BNB Testnet
npx hardhat run deployment/scripts/deploy.js --network bnbTestnet
```

### Interacting with the Contract

```bash
# Verify contract on BscScan
npx hardhat verify --network bnbTestnet <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> <CONSTRUCTOR_ARGS>

# Use Hardhat console for interaction
npx hardhat console --network bnbTestnet
```

## Design Decisions

### Minting Restrictions
- Only validators can mint new tokens to prevent inflation
- Minting is tied to trick validation events
- Daily minting limits per validator

### Validator System
- Multi-signature approval for adding new validators
- Validators stake T42 tokens as collateral
- Reputation-based validator selection

### Security Measures
- OpenZeppelin contracts for battle-tested security
- Reentrancy guards on all state-changing functions
- Access control for administrative functions
- Pausable mechanism for emergency situations

## Use Cases

1. **Trick Competitions**: Entry tokens for online/offline competitions
2. **Skill Verification**: Proof of trick mastery for sponsorships
3. **Community Rewards**: Incentivizing trick tutorials and mentorship
4. **Event Access**: VIP access to skateboarding events
5. **Marketplace**: Trading trick NFTs or skateboarding gear

## Future Roadmap

- Q2 2025: Mobile app integration for video submissions
- Q3 2025: AI-powered trick detection system
- Q4 2025: Partnership with major skateboarding brands
- Q1 2026: DAO governance implementation
